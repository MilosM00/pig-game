# Pig Game

### About the game:

This game is very fun and simple. Also, what is so good about this game is that you can play it with your friend. <br> <br>
Two players race to reach 100 points. <br>
A player repeatedly rolls dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds. <br>
 * If a player rolls 1 every roll before that is meaningless.
 * But if the player holds, every sum roll before that is inserted in results. <br>

There is maybe more to explain, but you will figure it out within the game.
